# Modeling guidelines

Modeling guidelines help you develop models and generate code using the MDDE Powerdesigner extentions. Applying these guidelines can improve the consistency, clarity, and readability of your models.

## Guidelines

1. Filter
Using the ON clause versus the WHERE clause to filter data will lead to different results.
For readability placing filter conditions in the WHERE is a good idea.

2. Attribute mappings
All attributes in an entity must be linked in the "attribute mappings" tab. (Hub/Link/Sattelite)
